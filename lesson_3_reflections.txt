When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

All the time. It is always better to a remote repository. The repo need not always be public, but it always seems better to set up a remote repository for you to have a back up, rather than having your work in your local, where a disk failure/system failure/thefts/ could mean that you lose all of your work.
--------------------

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- It would probably interfere with your work. It could be that git pulls its remotes when you are probably in the middle of working on the files which are changed on the remote.
- You'd probably be forced to manually merge intermediate files, files on which your work is as yet incomplete.
--------------------

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork - is a copy of someone else's GitHub repository under your GitHub repositories. It exists only in GitHub. It is basically a clone of the original repository, exisiting only on GitHub's servers

We use fork to make changes to a repository on GitHub when we don't have the rights to push the changes to the particular repository. So forking sets up a copy of the repository which we can clone and push changes to.

Clone - basically creates a copy of a repository. Cloning can create  a copy of either a remote repository or a local repository.

Generally, clone is used to create a copy of a remote repository, or a local repository. Clone is not limited to only GitHub and can be applied in general whenver a copy of the reposiotry is required.

Branches - basically are labels given tp a group of commits. They are generally used when we want to develop features independently of the normal process of bug fixes on the current working copy of the code. We could, on completion of the feature, choose to merge it back into the main branch, or discard it if we are not satisifed
--------------------

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

This is what allows us to find the changes made to files in the staging area. It also allows us to pull in recent remote commits, not merge them, and then compare the changes made locally with the most recent remote commits.
--------------------

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I guess I would be foreced to use other source control systems - SVN, TFS (if on Windows systems). The above mentioned ones are mostly central source control systems, so I'd have to be connected to the server to make commits - so working offline would definitely be difficult.

Also, the setup is a huge problem. Git and GitHub REALLY solve the setup issue for me. In others, I mostly have to set up a serve as the remote repository system.
